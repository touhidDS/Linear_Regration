# Student Performance Analysis (Multiple Linear Regration)

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of the **Student Performance Dataset**, a synthetic dataset from Kaggle designed to explore the factors influencing student academic performance. The dataset includes **10,000 student records** with various predictors and a performance index.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following variables:

- **Hours Studied**: Total hours spent studying.
- **Previous Scores**: Scores obtained in previous tests.
- **Extracurricular Activities**: Participation in extracurricular activities (**Yes/No**).
- **Sleep Hours**: Average daily sleep hours.
- **Sample Question Papers Practiced**: Number of sample papers practiced.
- **Performance Index** (**Target Variable**): A score from **10 to 100** representing academic performance.

## Analysis
The notebook in this repository explores the relationships between these factors and the **Performance Index** using data visualization and statistical techniques. It includes:

- **Data cleaning and preprocessing**
- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- **Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn**
- **Regression analysis to identify key predictors of student performance**
